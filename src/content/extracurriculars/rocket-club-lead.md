## Overview
As the head of the Rocket Club at Mines, I structured a new pole for experimental rocketry. I served as the primary interlocutor for **CNES** (French National Centre for Space Studies) under the PERSEUS project, aiming for a supersonic rocket launch in Kiruna.



## Key Responsibilities
* **Team Leadership:** Coordinated a team of 17 people, managing technical milestones and progression meetings.
* **Technical Oversight:** Supervised embedded electronics, avionics, and hardware maintenance for the rocket's flight systems.
* **Institutional Partnership:** Managed the strategic relationship with CNES and school administration to ensure project feasibility.

> "Managing a supersonic rocket project taught me that technical success is 50% engineering and 50% rigorous coordination."
