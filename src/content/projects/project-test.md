## Project Overview

This project was designed to solve the problem of "tab fatigue" in modern browsers. I wanted to create a centralized dashboard that pulls tasks from various sources into one clean interface.

## Key Features

* **Real-time sync:** Uses WebSockets for instant updates across devices.
* **Custom UI:** Built with **Tailwind CSS** for a minimalist look.
* **Performance:** Achieved a 100/100 Lighthouse score by leveraging Astro's static generation.

## Technical Challenges

One of the biggest hurdles was managing state between the server-rendered components and the interactive client-side widgets. I solved this by using **Nano Stores**, which kept the bundle size incredibly small.
